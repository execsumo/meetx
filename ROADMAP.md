# Heard — Roadmap

A living list of planned improvements and stretch ideas. Ordered by how close each item is to the current scope of `spec.md`. Anything that would change the product (cloud APIs, LLM integration, non-English transcription, Google Meet support) belongs in [What's explicitly NOT in scope](#whats-explicitly-not-in-scope) unless the spec itself changes.

## Near-term — polish & stability

These land inside the existing v1 scope and mostly tighten things the user already sees.

### Distribution & install
- **DMG packaging.** Add a `scripts/dmg.sh` that builds, signs, notarizes, and stamps out a DMG for GitHub Releases.
- **Homebrew Cask.** Draft a Cask formula so the app is installable via `brew install --cask heard` once the DMG pipeline is live.
- **Sparkle (or equivalent) update checker.** Explicitly out of scope per `spec.md`, but worth reconsidering once CI publishes releases.


### Meeting detection & recording
- **Audible meeting-start chime (opt-in).** A short non-intrusive sound confirms recording started. Off by default.

### Pipeline
- **Preprocessing concurrency guard.** Both tracks are currently preprocessed concurrently in a `TaskGroup`. On machines with tight memory, this doubles the peak RAM during VAD. Expose a setting to serialize preprocessing.
- **Per-job log viewer.** When a job fails, the error string is short. Capture a rolling per-job log (stdout/NSLog lines) and show it in a disclosure view.

## Mid-term — within-spec enhancements

Features that fit the on-device, single-process philosophy but require more code than a polish pass.

### Speaker management
- **Manual speaker split.** Inverse of merge — split a speaker profile if the user realizes two voices were collapsed.
- **Bulk-delete / archive old speakers.** Speakers with no meeting activity in N months.

### Pipeline & output
- **Alternative output formats.** Out of scope per spec today, but worth re-evaluating: plain `.txt`, `.srt`, VTT for video workflows, or a lightweight HTML with anchors.
- **Grounded speaker assignment.** Use the WeSpeaker embedding on the mic track to double-check that the "longest-duration speaker on mic = local user" heuristic holds. If it doesn't, fall back to prompting the user.

### Dictation
- **Dictation transcript log.** Optional history of dictated text (with timestamps and target-app name) for recovery if injection drops characters.

### Design ideas (from `design_handoff_app_surfaces`)
These surfaces are specified in the design handoff but not yet implemented:
- **First-run onboarding flow.** A 620×480px four-step permission wizard (Microphone → Screen Recording → System Audio → Accessibility) with progress indicator and Grant/Skip buttons. Shows on first launch before the main UI.
- **About as a modal sheet.** The design specifies About as a dimmed overlay sheet (380px wide) over the app, rather than a settings tab. Current tab is functional; this would be a polish upgrade.

### Diagnostics
- **In-app diagnostics pane.** Promote `scripts/diagnose.swift` into a hidden developer pane that surfaces Teams process IDs, active power assertions, CoreAudio device tree, and the most recent tap status.
- **One-click bug report bundle.** Zip up recent logs, `pipeline_queue.json`, and (opt-in) the last failed recording's WAVs for manual sharing.

## Long-term — bigger bets

These stretch the architecture and deserve a spec update before landing.

- **Live captions during the meeting.** The spec explicitly disables this to keep the Mac cool during calls; revisit once Apple Silicon idle cost improves or the user can opt-in per-meeting.
- **Sortformer diarizer.** FluidAudio includes `SortformerDiarizer` (~11% DER vs ~17.7% for current LS-EEND + WeSpeaker). Blocked by an embedding gap: Sortformer's `DiarizerTimeline` carries no per-segment speaker embeddings, which the cross-meeting speaker identity system requires. Unblock by adding a WeSpeaker embedding-extraction pass on Sortformer's segments before converting to `DiarizationResult`. Selectable per-meeting size makes sense (Sortformer has 4 fixed speaker slots).
- **Live speaker identification during the meeting.** Would need a streaming diarizer; today's LS-EEND is offline.

## Technical debt

- **In-meeting note editing.** Today the user edits notes by opening the rendered `.md` directly. A future polish: a "Notes" disclosure on each completed job in the menu bar dropdown that lists captured notes and lets the user edit/delete before the transcript is finalized (or rewrite the `.md` if it's already been written).
- **`Views.swift` size.** ~1.9 kLOC for all UI after the Paper design system landed. Split by tab once we're past the early iteration phase.
- **`SlidingWindowAsrConfig` doesn't expose `TdtConfig`.** The internal `asrConfig` hardcodes `TdtConfig()` (blankId 8192 = v3 default). `AsrManager` auto-adapts the blankId when it detects a mismatch against the loaded model, so v2 models work correctly today — but if FluidAudio ever removes that adaptation, v2 dictation would silently decode incorrectly. Upstream fix: add a `tdtConfig` parameter to `SlidingWindowAsrConfig`.

## Non-goals (from `spec.md`)

These are intentional exclusions. Don't add them without a spec update.

- LLM integration (no Claude, OpenAI, or local LLM)
- Cloud APIs of any kind
- Non-English transcription / multilingual models
- Google Meet support (browser-tab; no per-meeting power assertion to detect)
- Manual app recording (pick any app)
- System-wide audio capture
- Multiple output formats beyond Markdown
- Configurable VAD threshold or speaker count
- macOS notifications
- Live captions or live speaker ID during meetings
- Batch import of existing recordings
- Pre-release update channels
- Dictation voice commands (`"scratch that"`, `"new paragraph"`) and spoken punctuation
