# Heard

A macOS menu bar app that automatically detects Microsoft Teams meetings, records dual-track audio (app + mic), and produces on-device transcripts with speaker diarization. Also includes a real-time dictation mode that types transcribed speech into any focused text field.

No cloud, no LLM, no external APIs — everything runs on-device on Apple Silicon.

## Features

### Meeting Transcription
- **Teams auto-detection** — Polls `IOPMCopyAssertionsByProcess()` every 3 seconds for Teams power assertions (`PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep` / `NoDisplaySleepAssertion` / "Call in progress"). Requires 2 consecutive hits before triggering; applies a 5-second cooldown on end. Recognises Teams classic, New Teams, and "work or school" variants.
- **Meeting title extraction** — Reads the Teams window title via the Accessibility API and strips the ` | Microsoft Teams` suffix for the transcript filename.
- **Dual-track recording** — The mic track is captured via `AVAudioEngine`; the app track is captured via `CATapDescription` + a private aggregate device + a raw AUHAL output unit. The tap collects **all** Teams-related CoreAudio process object IDs (main + renderer children) so audio from Electron/Chromium sub-processes isn't lost. Both tracks land on disk as 48 kHz WAVs and are never mixed during recording.
- **Roster scraping** — Reads Teams participant names via Accessibility APIs every 15 s while a meeting is active. Three strategies: known roster-panel identifiers → AXList/AXTable containers → window-title parsing. Filters out UI control strings (mute, raise hand, etc.).
- **On-device pipeline** — Sequential stages per job: preprocessing (48 kHz → 16 kHz mono via `AVAudioConverter`, in-memory Silero VAD trimming + `VadSegmentMap`) → Parakeet TDT V2/V3 transcription (per-track, parallel 4-chunk processing, with CTC vocabulary boosting) → Inverse Text Normalization (punctuation formatting) → LS-EEND + WeSpeaker diarization → speaker assignment and Markdown output.
- **Speaker identification** — Cosine-distance matching (threshold 0.40, confidence margin 0.10) against a persistent speaker database, with embedding diversity management and auto-update on confident matches. Uses UUID-based placeholders (e.g. `Speaker_1AB23C`) to guarantee universally unique speaker profiles.
- **Cumulative transcription stats** — Every transcribed segment seamlessly increments the matched speaker's total transcribed hours and word count, which are visible in the Settings tab.
- **Roster-aware auto-naming** — When one speaker is unmatched and exactly one roster name is unclaimed, the roster name is assigned automatically without prompting.
- **Speaker naming window** — When unmatched speakers remain, a dedicated "Name Speakers" window opens with a **playable audio clip** (~10 s of each speaker's clearest speech, extracted from the 48 kHz recording), a text field pre-populated with any roster suggestion, and a 120 s auto-dismiss countdown.
- **Custom vocabulary boosting** — CTC-based keyword boosting via `Parakeet CTC 110M` applied to both meeting transcription and dictation. Terms are added from Settings → General (min 3 chars, max 50 terms). Falls back gracefully if the CTC model can't be loaded.
- **Persistent job queue** — `pipeline_queue.json` survives app restarts; failed jobs are re-queued on relaunch up to a lifetime cap of 6 retries. Non-retryable errors (no audio, too short) fail immediately; transient errors retry 3× per session with exponential backoff (5 s, 30 s, 5 min). User-initiated retry resets the count.
- **Long-meeting handling** — 4 h hard cap; on hit, the current recording is finalized and a fresh one starts if the meeting is still active.
- **Markdown output** — Timestamped, speaker-labeled transcripts written to a configurable output folder. Filename dates are configurable (`YYMMDD` or `YYYY-MM-DD`). Consecutive segments from the same speaker are merged into continuous blocks.

### Dictation
- **Real-time speech-to-text** — Uses FluidAudio's `SlidingWindowAsrManager` with overlapping windows and an internal stable/volatile text split. Audio is fed as `AVAudioPCMBuffer` straight from the mic tap; the manager handles resampling, chunking, and context accumulation internally.
- **Incremental injection** — Confirmed text flows word by word in real time as the sliding window confirms it; remaining volatile text is flushed on stop. No batching — typed as you speak.
- **Punctuation normalization** — FluidAudio's Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) runs natively, converting spoken forms like "comma", "period", and "new line" to their written equivalents seamlessly before text injection.
- **Filler word stripping** — Standalone instances of "uh", "um", "er", "ah", "hmm", "hm", "uhh", "umm", "mhm" are automatically removed before injection; word boundaries and case-insensitivity apply. Keeps transcripts clean without user intervention.
- **Vocabulary boosting** — When CTC models are downloaded, `configureVocabularyBoosting()` is applied so custom terms take effect in real time.
- **Text injection** — `CGEvent.keyboardSetUnicodeString` + `postToPid` targets the frontmost app; falls back to HID-level events, then clipboard paste. All paths require Accessibility permission.
- **Global hotkey** — Default ⌃⇧D, registered via Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`. No Accessibility permission needed for the hotkey itself, so it keeps working across ad-hoc rebuilds. Rebindable via a Record sheet in the Dictation tab. Hotkey input is validated to block forbidden system shortcuts and warn on weak combos.
- **Hotkey reuse fix** — Proper cleanup after stopping — `SlidingWindowAsrManager.cleanup()` closes the internal `AsyncStream` before starting a new session, preventing state corruption from rapid presses. State validation throws `DictationError.notIdle` to surface conflicts.
- **Accessibility revocation detection** — If the user revokes Accessibility permission mid-dictation, `AppModel.startAXPolling()` detects it every 2 seconds and gracefully stops, showing an orange banner with a "Re-grant Access…" button.
- **Floating dictation indicator (HUD)** — An optional on-screen pill at the bottom-center shows "Dictating" with a waveform icon while active (opt-in via Settings → Dictation). Appears at full opacity, dims to 35% after 2.5 seconds, and fades out on stop.
- **Toggle and push-to-talk modes** — Tap to toggle, or hold the hotkey to dictate and release to stop.
- **Model keep-alive** — ASR models stay resident for a configurable period (0 – 10 min, default 120 s) after dictation stops to avoid reload latency between utterances.

### UI
- **Menu bar icon** — SF Symbols with symbol effects: static `recordingtape` when idle, pulsing/breathing `record.circle` while recording or dictating, iterative `waveform` while processing, `exclamationmark.circle.fill` on error, `person.crop.circle.badge.exclamationmark` when waiting for speaker naming. Icon uses **accent tint** (blue) when actively capturing audio (recording or dictating) and **primary tint** (white/dark gray) otherwise. **Opacity** is 100% when the app is watching or recording, and 50% when paused (phase is dormant, not dictating, and meeting detection is off).
- **Menu bar dropdown** — Current status card (watching/recording/processing/dictating), **Recent Meetings** list (up to 3 completed/failed jobs with click-to-open and right-click to reveal/retry/dismiss), quick actions (start dictation, open transcripts, name speakers, settings, quit), and developer-mode simulate buttons.
- **Settings window** — Five tabs: **General** (launch at login, auto-watch, developer mode, custom vocabulary, output folder, permissions), **Dictation** (enable, push-to-talk, hotkey recorder with validation feedback, model keep-alive slider, live status, show dictation HUD checkbox), **Models** (download cards with progress, pipeline keep-alive, "Unload All Models"), **Speakers** (your name, inline rename, merge, delete, search, sort, with prompts to retroactively update all past transcripts), **About**.
- **Name Speakers window** — Standalone scene with audio-clip playback per candidate, roster-suggestion hints, save/skip, and a 120 s countdown.

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0+
- Apple Silicon (FluidAudio CoreML/ANE models are ARM-only)
- [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) 0.14.3+ (resolved automatically via SPM)

## Build & Run

```bash
# Compile only
swift build

# Run from the terminal (⚠ mic permission is attributed to the terminal, not Heard)
swift run Heard

# Build a .app bundle and launch it (recommended for day-to-day use)
./scripts/bundle.sh
open build/Heard.app

# Stable-signed build — required for dictation so the Accessibility grant
# persists across rebuilds. Replace "Heard Dev" with any local identity.
./scripts/bundle.sh --sign "Heard Dev"
open build/Heard.app

# Release build
./scripts/bundle.sh --release
```

> **Tip:** If dictation's Accessibility grant gets stuck after rebuilds, reset it with `tccutil reset Accessibility com.execsumo.heard` and re-grant.

## Architecture

Single-process SwiftUI menu bar app. Three scenes: a `MenuBarExtra(.window)` dropdown, a Settings `Window`, and a Speaker Naming `Window`. `WindowActivationCoordinator` reference-counts `.regular` activation policy across the two windows so keyboard focus survives closing one while the other stays open. All persistence is JSON files under `~/Library/Application Support/Heard/`.

### Targets

| Target | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `HeardCore` | library | All models, services, views, stores |
| `Heard` | executable | `@main` app entry, depends on `HeardCore` |
| `HeardTests` | executable | Test runner with a lightweight in-house harness |

### Key Design Decisions

- **No sandbox.** Required for `CATapDescription` app-audio tapping and `CGEvent` text injection. The entitlements file grants `audio-input` and nothing else.
- **AUHAL + private aggregate device for the tap.** `AVAudioEngine.inputNode` silently re-binds to the system default input when `prepare()` runs after a `kAudioOutputUnitProperty_CurrentDevice` change, so a standalone `kAudioUnitSubType_HALOutput` configured *before* `AudioUnitInitialize` is the only reliable path to capture from the tap's aggregate device.
- **Multi-process Teams tap.** New Teams renders audio in renderer/GPU child processes, not in the process holding the power assertion. The recorder enumerates every Teams-related CoreAudio process object and taps them all.
- **SlidingWindowAsrManager for dictation.** Dictation uses FluidAudio's `SlidingWindowAsrManager` with the `.streaming` preset (11 s chunks, 2 s left/right context). The manager handles overlapping windows, resampling, and stable/volatile text promotion internally. Confirmed text is injected incrementally; remaining volatile text is flushed on stop. This also restores vocabulary boosting, which was removed from the batch `AsrManager` API in FluidAudio 0.13.6.
- **Carbon for global hotkeys.** `RegisterEventHotKey` doesn't need Accessibility permission and survives ad-hoc rebuilds, unlike `CGEvent.tapCreate` or `NSEvent` monitors (which can't suppress events).
- **Per-track transcription.** The app and mic tracks are transcribed separately, then merged by timestamp. Avoids crosstalk artifacts from a pre-mixed source.
- **Local user is the mic track.** No diarization needed to identify the local user — the mic track is always "Me" (or the name set in Settings → Speakers). The mic embedding is stored and updated silently each meeting.

## Models

All models are CoreML, loaded via [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) into `~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/`. They auto-download on first use or can be pre-downloaded from Settings → Models.

| Kind | Model | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `batchVad` | Silero VAD v6 | In-memory silence trimming during preprocessing |
| `batchParakeet` | Parakeet TDT V2 0.6B (default) or V3 | English speech-to-text for meetings and dictation. V2 is recommended for English; V3 adds a Cyrillic-script guard. Selectable in Settings → Models. |
| `diarization` | LS-EEND + WeSpeaker | Speaker segmentation + 256-d embedding extraction |
| `ctcVocabulary` | Parakeet CTC 110M | Optional CTC vocabulary boosting for custom terms |

Pipeline models stay unloaded during recording. The Models tab exposes **pipeline keep-alive** (how long meeting models stay resident after a job completes, 0 – 10 min) and a **force-unload** button. The Dictation tab has its own keep-alive slider for the dictation ASR.

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose | When required |
|---|---|---|
| Microphone | Record the local user | Always |
| Screen Recording | Surface the Teams window title for nicer filenames | Recommended |
| Accessibility | Read Teams window title & roster, inject dictation text | Required for dictation; recommended for roster-based auto-naming |

Only Microphone is strictly required; everything else degrades gracefully. Permission status is shown inside the General tab with deep-links to the right System Settings pane.

## Data

```
~/Library/Application Support/Heard/
├── pipeline_queue.json   # Persistent job queue
├── speakers.json         # Speaker embeddings + metadata
└── recordings/           # 48 kHz WAVs, auto-cleaned after 48 h

~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/
├── silero-vad-coreml/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-coreml/      # or parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml/ if V3 selected
├── speaker-diarization-coreml/
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-ctc-110m-coreml/

~/Documents/Heard/        # Default transcript output (configurable)
└── 260324_Sprint_Planning.md # Or 2026-03-24_Sprint_Planning.md based on settings
```

Orphan WAVs from previous crashes are cleaned on launch, and any private aggregate devices left behind by a crashed recording (`com.execsumo.heard.tap.*`) are destroyed at the same time. Files referenced by an in-flight pipeline job are always preserved.

## Testing

```bash
swift run HeardTests
```

109 tests covering `VadSegmentMap`, cosine distance, `SpeakerMatcher`, `SegmentMerger`, `AudioPreprocessor`, `TranscriptWriter`, `SpeakerStore`, `PipelineQueueStore`, and `RosterReader` via a lightweight in-house harness — no XCTest or Xcode required.

**Manual smoke test:** `./scripts/bundle.sh && open build/Heard.app`, enable Developer Mode in Settings → General, then use **Simulate Meeting** from the menu bar to exercise the full flow without a real Teams call.

**Diagnostics:** `swift scripts/diagnose.swift` prints what Heard sees from Teams processes and power assertions — useful for debugging detection on a specific machine.
